# outline-shader
This is a shader that uses vert normals to make a "line drawing" of a 3D mesh. It can easily give the appearance of a pen drawing or a hologram. It was created with an orthographic camera in mind.

Keep in mind that this was made for Unity 5.1.1f1. It can still be used as-is in that version, but might use some obsolete APIs for the most recent Unity.

The 3D models included in this demo:
The [skull model](https://sketchfab.com/models/1a9db900738d44298b0bc59f68123393) was created by Martin Jario.
The [biped robot model](https://sketchfab.com/models/801d2a245e4a4405a0c2152b35b5e486) was created by Willy Decarpentrie.
